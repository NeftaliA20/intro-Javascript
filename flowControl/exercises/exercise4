//What does the following code log to the console, and why?

function barCodeScanner(serial) {
  switch (serial) {
    case '123':
      console.log('Product1');
    case '113':
      console.log('Product2');
    case '142':
      console.log('Product3');
    default:
      console.log('Product not found!');
  }
}

barCodeScanner('113');

This program logs 'Product2' , 'Product3', and 'Product not found!'.
There are no breaks on the switch statements, which cause the program
to log everything causing a fall-through behavior in the program.
